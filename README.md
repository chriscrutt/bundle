# Bundle - your friggin cryptos

## Introduction
We aim to create a robust, intuitive way to invest in a bundle of cryptocurrencies to help hedge against losses

## Technologies
We use fancy API technology oooh aaah and our functions are programmed by a 19 year-old student who knows half of what he's doing

## Launch
def not ready for that yet

## Mini Tut
### for test.py
1. Delete the first 5 lines as they let the author/committers put API keys on a seperate file so y'all don't go hacking into our accounts
2. replace `api_key` and `api_secret` with your... api keys from Binance

**or (alternative)**
1. create a file called `apis.py`
2. create the variables `api_key` and `api_secret` and set them to their respective keys inside of that `apis.py` file
