## Questions to be answered
- [ ] how many coins should we use?
- [ ] What should a coin have to drop below in order to sell and switch to another?
- [ ] should we invest in stablecoins?

## Goals
### Look at 2-3 funds:
- [ ] Long term fund with biannual & yearly volume & Market Cap as focus
- [ ] Medium Term Fund with coins being pulled from both Long Term Fund and Short Term Fund. Semi Aggressive with long term stability as well.
- [ ] Short Term Fund/Aggressive Focus on Daily and monthly volume increase in Market Cap
- [ ] Amount of Shares/Tokens?
    - [ ] How many ETFs would we need to create - for example if we had a total of $1,000,000 (including liabilities I dont know doesn't matter for the example) in assets, if we had would we want to split it into 50,000 shares to make it ~$20 per etf (starting).
    - [ ] Look at overall supply to price
